# IPC contract (UI ↔ Rust core)

The UI never talks to Plex, the network, files or audio directly. It calls the
Tauri commands and listens for the events listed here. Types are in `src-tauri/src/model.rs` (Rust, canonical) and
mirrored in `src/lib/types.ts`. Wire format is camelCase JSON.

The UI reaches the core only through `src/lib/backend.ts`. Inside the app it
uses the real Tauri bridge; in a plain browser it uses an in-memory mock with
fixture data, so screens can be built, screenshotted (Playwright) and tested
(Vitest) without a server.

Errors: commands return `Result<T, AppError>`; `AppError` serializes as
`{ kind: string, message: string }` where `kind` is one of `network`,
`auth`, `notFound`, `server`, `io`, `decode`, `invalid`, `internal`.

## Artwork
A custom URI scheme, served by Rust from the disk cache (LRU, 2 GB default):
`art://localhost/<urlencoded plex image path>?w=<px>&h=<px>`
On Windows (WebView2) the URL form is `http://art.localhost/...`, so always use
`artUrl()` in `backend.ts` instead of building it by hand. It takes the
rendered size in CSS px and asks for that times the display's pixel ratio,
rounded up to a fixed set of sizes (`src/lib/artSize.ts`) so nearby sizes
share cache entries. On a cache miss Rust
fetches `/photo/:/transcode` at the requested size. The token never appears in
the URL.

## Auth and servers
| Command | Args | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auth_status` | – | `AuthStatus` |
| `auth_start` | – | `PinInfo { code, authUrl, expiresAt }` (also opens the browser) |
| `auth_cancel` | – | – |
| `auth_sign_out` | – | – |
| `servers_list` | – | `ServerInfo[]` |
| `server_select` | `{ machineId }` | – |

`AuthStatus = { state: "signedOut" | "pending" | "signedIn", username?, server?: ServerInfo, needsServerPick: bool, reauthRequired: bool }`

`reauthRequired` means Plex rejected the saved sign-in (expired or revoked).
The app stays open so music on this computer keeps playing, and the health
banner asks the user to sign in again.
`ServerInfo = { machineId, name, owned, online, version?, connection?: "local"|"remote"|"relay" }`

Event `auth://changed` → `AuthStatus`.

## Library
| Command | Args | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sync_status` | – | `SyncStatus` |
| `sync_now` | `{ full?: bool }` | – |
| `home` | – | `HomeData { recentlyPlayed: Album[], recentlyAdded: Album[], jumpBackIn: Album[] }` |
| `artists` | `{ sort: "name"|"recent"|"plays", offset, limit }` | `Page<Artist>` |
| `artist_names` | – | `{ id, title }[]` (every artist) |
| `albums` | `{ sort: "name"|"artist"|"year"|"recent"|"plays", offset, limit, section?: ReleaseSection }` | `Page<Album>` |
| `playlists` | – | `Playlist[]` |
| `library_items` | – | `LibraryItem[]` (every playlist, album and artist, unordered) |
| `artist_page` | `{ id }` | `ArtistPage { artist, popular: Track[], sections: { section, albums: Album[] }[], plays, about?, similar: Artist[] }` |
| `album_page` | `{ id }` | `AlbumPage { album, tracks: Track[], totalDurationMs, moreByArtist: Album[] }` |
| `playlist_page` | `{ id }` | `{ playlist, tracks: Track[] }` |

`Page<T> = { items: T[], total }`.
`artist_names` feeds the artist links in track lines: the UI loads it once,
keeps it, and loads it again after `library://changed`. A track's
`ratingCount` (global listener count, absent when Plex has none) ranks the
artist page's `popular` list: songs with a count first, highest first, then
the rest by your own plays. `popular` also has songs where the artist is
credited in the track artist line, at most 10, one copy per song.
On the artist page, `plays` is the sum of play counts over the artist's own
tracks, `about` is the Plex artist biography (null when empty), and `similar`
holds the Plex similar artists that are in this library, at most 12, in
Plex's order. Artist lists never carry the biography. Similar artists come
from the artist's detail, not from sync: `artist_page` answers with what's
cached and, when that is missing or a week old, fetches it in the background
and then emits `artist://changed` with `{ id }` so the page can ask again.

`LibraryItem = { kind: "playlist"|"album"|"artist", id, title, sortTitle, creator?, creatorId?, thumb?, smart, format?, addedAt?, playedAt? }`
feeds the library sidebar, which sorts and filters it in the UI. `creator` is
the album artist and `creatorId` its id (albums only). `addedAt` is Plex's addedAt for albums and the
earliest of an artist's albums for artists; playlists have none. `playedAt` is
the latest play in Plex history or the local listen log (and Plex's
lastViewedAt) for albums, an artist's newest album play, and the latest local
play started from a playlist. Times are unix seconds.
`SyncStatus = { phase: "idle"|"artists"|"albums"|"tracks"|"incremental", done, total, lastSyncAt? }`
Event `sync://progress` → `SyncStatus`; event `library://changed` (no payload)
after any sync writes, so open pages refetch.

## Now playing
| Command | Args | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `now_playing_details` | `{ trackId }` | `NowPlayingDetails { trackId, artist?, credits, lyrics? }` |

The extras the now-playing panel shows for a track, read from Plex when the
panel needs them (not cached in the library database).
`artist = { id, title, summary?, thumb?, art? }` is the album artist with its
Plex bio and photo. `credits = { name, roles: ("composer"|"writer"|"lyricist"|"producer")[] }[]`
lists people Plex credits beyond the track's artists; it is often empty.
`lyrics = { synced, lines: string[] }` is there only when the track has a
lyrics stream with words in it. Lines come without timestamps and `""` marks a
break between verses; `synced` says the source was timed. Only the track
request can fail the call: when the artist or lyrics request fails, that part
is just left out.

## Search
| Command | Args | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `search` | `{ query, filter: "all"|"songs"|"artists"|"albums"|"playlists", limit? }` | `SearchResults { top?: SearchHit, songs: Track[], artists: Artist[], albums: Album[], playlists: Playlist[], tookMs, source: "local"|"server" }` |
| `recent_searches` | – | `string[]` |
| `recent_search_add` | `{ query }` | – |
| `recent_searches_clear` | – | – |

`SearchHit = { kind: "artist"|"album"|"track"|"playlist", artist?, album?, track?, playlist? }`

Until the first library sync has finished, `search` asks the server instead
(`/hubs/search`), ranks the answer with the same rules and returns
`source: "server"`. If the server is slow or unreachable it answers from the
cache. After the first sync, search never touches the network.

## Playback and queue
| Command | Args |
| --- | --- |
| `play_context` | `{ context: { kind: "album"|"playlist"|"artist"|"tracks"|"search", id?, trackIds? }, startTrackId?, shuffle? }` |
| `play_toggle`, `play_pause`, `play_resume`, `play_next`, `play_previous` | – |
| `play_seek` | `{ positionMs }` |
| `set_volume` | `{ volume: 0..1 }` (linear slider value; core applies the perceptual curve) |
| `set_muted` | `{ muted }` |
| `set_shuffle` | `{ shuffle }` (for the playing context) |
| `set_context_shuffle` | `{ contextId, shuffle }` (applies now if that context is playing, otherwise the next time it plays) |
| `set_repeat` | `{ repeat: "off"|"all"|"one" }` |
| `queue_add` | `{ trackIds, at: "next"|"end" }` |
| `queue_remove` | `{ itemId }` |
| `queue_move` | `{ itemId, toIndex }` (index within the user queue) |
| `queue_clear` | – (clears the user queue only) |
| `queue_jump` | `{ itemId }` (play that item now) |
| `player_state` | – → `PlayerState` |

`PlayerState = { status: "idle"|"loading"|"playing"|"paused"|"buffering"|"error", track?: Track, positionMs, durationMs, volume, muted, shuffle, shuffledContexts: string[], repeat, queue: QueueView }`
`QueueView = { current?: QueueItem, userQueue: QueueItem[], nextUp: QueueItem[], history: QueueItem[], context?: { kind, id?, title? } }`
`QueueItem = { itemId, track: Track, source: "user"|"context" }`

Shuffle is remembered per album, playlist or artist id; repeat is one global
setting. `shuffle` is the playing context's state and `shuffledContexts` lists
every context id whose shuffle is on, so a page can show its own toggle for a
context that isn't playing. `play_context` without `shuffle` uses that
context's stored value; passing `shuffle` sets it.

Queue rules the core applies:
- Without `startTrackId`, a context starts at its resume point (the track and
  position it was left at) when shuffle is off, at track 1 if it was never
  played, and on a random track when shuffle is on. Resume points and shuffle
  values are saved with the queue, for the 200 most recently used contexts.
- `play_previous` within the first 3 s goes to the previous position in the
  context's play order (the shuffled order when shuffled). Queued songs are
  never a target; on a playing queued song it drops that song and goes back
  to the context track before it. On the first track, or at 3 s or later, it
  restarts the track.
- In repeat-one, `play_next` or an early `play_previous` switches repeat to
  all. A late `play_previous` restarts and keeps repeat-one.
- When the context runs out with repeat off, the player goes back to its first
  track, paused at 0:00, with the rest of the context as upcoming.

Events:
- `player://state` → `PlayerState` (on any state/track/queue change)
- `player://position` → `{ positionMs, durationMs, bufferedMs }` (4×/s while playing)
- `player://error` → `{ trackId?, kind, message }` (e.g. "Skipped: file unavailable")

## Output devices
| Command | Args |
| --- | --- |
| `output_devices` | – → `OutputState` |
| `output_select` | `{ deviceId: string \| null }` → `OutputState` (null follows the system default) |

`OutputState = { devices: OutputDevice[], selected: string | null, current: OutputDevice | null }`
`OutputDevice = { id, name, isDefault }`

`id` is the OS's stable device id. `selected` is the chosen device, or null
when playback follows the system default. `current` is the device playing, or
the one the next play would open. Switching moves the open stream at once and
keeps the position and play state. The choice is saved as the
`outputDevice` setting (this device only); `settings_set` doesn't change it.
An unknown id is a `notFound` error.

While following the system default, a change of default moves playback to
the new device without stopping. If the device in use is unplugged, playback
pauses and Play resumes on whatever output is there. If that device was the
chosen one, the choice drops back to the system default for this session
and `output://lost` fires; the saved setting is kept, so the device is used
again at the next start if it's back.

Events:
- `output://changed` → `OutputState` (after a switch, a fallback, or a reroute)
- `output://lost` → `{ device }` (name of the chosen device that went away)

## Health and app states
| Command | Returns |
| --- | --- |
| `health` | `Health` |
| `cached_tracks` | `string[]` (ids of tracks stored on this computer) |

`Health = { status: "local"|"remote"|"relay"|"offline"|"starting"|"updating"|"noAuth", serverName?, connection?, latencyMs?, serverVersion?, lastSeenAt? (Unix ms), scan?: { done, total }, banner?: { kind, message }, filesAvailable: bool, cachedOnly: bool }`

`banner.kind` is one of `offline`, `noInternet`, `starting`, `updating`,
`startTimeout`, `relay`, `signIn`, `accessRemoved`, `filesUnavailable`,
`noMusicLibrary`, `diskFull`; `message` is the text to show. `scan` counts new
tracks while Plex scans ("Adding new music… 120 of 340"). `cachedOnly` is true
while only music already on this computer can play; the UI then asks
`cached_tracks` and dims the rest. See docs/APP-STATES.md.

Event `health://changed` → `Health`. Event `toast` → `{ kind: "info"|"error", message }`.

## Settings and tracking
| Command | Args |
| --- | --- |
| `settings_get` | – → `Settings { privateSession, reportToPlex, volume, shuffleStyle, ... }` |
| `settings_set` | `{ patch: Partial<Settings> }` |
| `art_cache_info` | – → `{ usedBytes, capBytes }` |
| `art_cache_clear` | – → bytes freed (number) |

`privateSession` (default false) stops plays being written to the local
listen log. `reportToPlex` (default true) controls timeline and scrobble
reports; when it's off nothing is sent or queued. `volume` is the same 0..1
value as `set_volume`; setting it here also moves the player. `shuffleStyle`
is `"spread"` (default: keeps an artist's songs apart and pushes recently
played ones back) or `"standard"` (plain random order). Settings are
stored in the local database and apply immediately.

The rest of the fields, with their defaults:

| Field | Values | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `qualityHome` | `"original"`, `"320"`, `"256"`, `"192"`, `"128"` | Bitrate cap on the local connection. Original plays the file as is. |
| `qualityAway` | same, default `"320"` | Cap over remote access and the relay. The relay never goes above 128 kbps. |
| `showFormatBadge` | bool, true | Shows the codec and sample rate badge in track lists and album headers. |
| `resumeContexts` | bool, true | Albums and playlists start where they were left. Off starts at track 1; points are still saved. |
| `precacheCount` | 1 to 50, 5 | Upcoming tracks kept on disk. Out of range values are clamped. |
| `popularSource` | `"global"`, `"myPlays"` | Ranks the artist page's Popular by listener counts or by your own plays. |
| `artCacheMb` | 128 to 51200, 2048 | Artwork cache size. Shrinking it removes the oldest images at once. |
| `artworkColours` | bool, true | Headers tint from artwork. Off gives every header the same neutral colour. |
| `reduceMotion` | `"system"`, `"on"`, `"off"` | Follow the OS setting, or force reduced motion on or off. |
| `outputDevice` | device id or null, null | Read only here. Set with `output_select`; null follows the system default. |

Quality changes apply from the next track. Settings saved by an older build
load with these defaults for anything missing.

## Updates
| Command | Returns |
| --- | --- |
| `update_check` | `{ available: bool, version?, notes? }` |
| `update_install_on_restart` | – |
| `app_info` | – → `{ version, licence, repoUrl }` |
| `open_project_page` | – (opens the project page in the default browser) |

Event `update://ready` → `{ version }`.
